  - name: wrk_foretak_020
    description: This dbt model is a refinement of the 'wrk_foretak_010' model, focusing
      specifically on companies within the national business register (foretak_siste)
      that operate in the agriculture sector. It achieves this focus by selecting
      companies whose primary industry code (nace_1) begins with '1', which corresponds
      to the agriculture sector according to the NACE classification system. As such,
      this model provides a narrowed-down dataset comprising company IDs, names, employee
      counts, and primary industry codes for companies operating within the agriculture
      sector.
    columns:
      - name: orgnr
        description: The official ID of the company as registered in the national
          business registry. This is a string representation of the 'organisasjonsnummer'
          field sourced from 'foretak_siste'. It uniquely identifies each company
          within the dataset.
      - name: navn
        description: The registered name of the company as it appears in 'foretak_siste'.
          This field provides the official legal name under which the company operates.
      - name: antall_ansatte
        description: The count of employees working for the company, reported through
          A-ordningen. It is derived from the 'antallansatte' field in 'foretak_siste',
          representing the total number of individuals employed by the company.
      - name: nace_1
        description: The primary industry code of the company according to the 5-digit
          NACE, SN07 format (NN.NNN). This code indicates the sector in which the
          company operates (in this model's case, companies whose nace_1 begins with
          '1' are within the agriculture sector). It is sourced from 'naeringskode1_kode'
          in 'foretak_siste' and plays a critical role in the filtering applied in
          this model.
