  - name: l2_job_ads
    description: This dbt model, `l2_job_ads`, consolidates job advertisements from
      the upstream 'all_jobs' table, ensuring each job ID (stillingsnummer) is represented
      by its most recently registered entry. The transformation entails selecting
      the latest ad per job ID based on the registration date and standardizing location
      information to refer specifically to company (foretak) details. The model primarily
      serves to streamline job advertisement data for analytics, removing duplicates
      and aligning with the most current information.
